# **RV32G_Core**  
## **Project Description:**  
RV32G_Core is a 32-bit RISC-V processor currently under development. This processor is designed to support a range of RISC-V extensions, making it suitable for embedded and real-time applications. The core is optimized for performance, efficiency, and flexibility while maintaining compliance with the RISC-V standard.

32-bit RISC-V core with IMFA extension 
RV32G_Core is a 32-bit RISC-V processor currently under development, supporting the following extensions:  
- **Integer (I)**
- **Integer Multiply and Divide (M)**   
- **Atomic (A)**  
- **Single/Double-Precision Floating Point (FD)**  
- **Control and Status Register (ZiCsr)**  

## **Features:**  
- **Instruction and Data Cache** for improved memory access efficiency  
- **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)** and **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** with **Physical Memory Protection (PMP)**  
- **Core Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC)** for advanced interrupt handling  
- **Machine CSR support** for efficient interrupt management  
- **Supports FreeRTOS**, enabling real-time operating system compatibility  

This project focuses on developing a high-performance and configurable RISC-V core with robust memory and interrupt management capabilities.
